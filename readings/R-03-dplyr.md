Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**
===================================================

The bracket subsetting we discussed in the [previous
reading](../R-02-starting-with-data) is handy, but it can be cumbersome
and difficult to read, especially for complicated operations. Enter
**`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data
manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you
to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and
analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do
more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or
`data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more
functions. Before you use a package for the first time you need to
install it on your machine, and then you should import it in every
subsequent R session when you need it. You should now install the
**`tidyverse`** package, if you haven't already done so.

``` {.r}
##Only run this if you haven't already installed it
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for
data analysis which work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**,
**`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise
when doing data analysis with some of functions that come with R:

1.  The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of
    data.
2.  Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing
    for new learners.
3.  Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are
    not aware of.

We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a
data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced
(=converted) into the `factor` data type. We had to set
**`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to
convert our data type.

This time will use the **`tidyverse`** package to read the data and
avoid having to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

To load the package type:

``` {.r}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library("tidyverse")
```

What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?
-------------------------------------

The package **`dplyr`**, contained in **`tidyverse`**, provides easy
tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work
directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being
written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the
ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The
benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a
relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only
the results of the query are returned.

This addresses a common problem with R -- all operations are conducted
in-memory, so the amount of data you can work with is limited by
available memory. The database connections essentially remove that
limitation; you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB,
conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need
for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to
reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions.
Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement.
Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own
column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups. Moving back and
forth between these formats is nontrivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you
tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** for future work, you may
want to check out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`**
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about
**`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the
tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.

``` {.r}
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

## inspect the data
str(surveys)

## preview the data using R's excel-like data viewer
View(surveys)
```

When you run this code, you'll notice that the class of the data is now
`tbl_df`.

This is referred to as a "tibble". Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors
of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous episode. The
data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the
only differences are that:

1.  In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its
    name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many
    columns as fit on one screen.
2.  Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.

So don't really worry about it. Tibbles are just well-behaved data
frames.

Now we're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

-   `select()`: subset columns
-   `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
-   `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other
    columns
-   `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statisitcs on grouped
    data
-   `arrange()`: sort results
-   `count()`: count discrete values

Selecting columns and filtering rows
------------------------------------

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to
this function is the data frame (here it is `surveys`), and the
subsequent arguments are the columns that you want to keep.

``` {.r}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

``` {.r}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

Note that in the examples above, you didn't actually define a new data
frame with the filtered or selected data. To do that, you'd need to go
back to basics and use `<-` with a name for your new data frame. For
example,

``` {.r}
surveys_1995 <- filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

Pipes
-----

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With *intermediate steps*, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

``` {.r}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects
that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be
hard to keep track of.

You can also *nest functions* (i.e. one function inside of another),
like this:

``` {.r}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are
nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case,
filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is
useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R
look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package,
installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can
type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if
you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you
have a Mac. **(Make sure you've loaded the `tidyverse` package or just
the `dplyr` package using the `library()` function before you use
pipes!)**

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

    ## # A tibble: 17 x 3
    ##    species_id sex   weight
    ##    <chr>      <chr>  <int>
    ##  1 PF         F          4
    ##  2 PF         F          4
    ##  3 PF         M          4
    ##  4 RM         F          4
    ##  5 RM         M          4
    ##  6 PF         <NA>       4
    ##  7 PP         M          4
    ##  8 RM         M          4
    ##  9 RM         M          4
    ## 10 RM         M          4
    ## 11 PF         M          4
    ## 12 PF         F          4
    ## 13 RM         M          4
    ## 14 RM         M          4
    ## 15 RM         F          4
    ## 16 RM         M          4
    ## 17 RM         M          4

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first
through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then
through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`
columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the
first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly
include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()`
functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For
instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then*
we `filter`ed for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns
`species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by
themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear
workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of
data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data,
we can assign it a new name in the first row of our series of piped
commands:

``` {.r}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

    ## # A tibble: 17 x 3
    ##    species_id sex   weight
    ##    <chr>      <chr>  <int>
    ##  1 PF         F          4
    ##  2 PF         F          4
    ##  3 PF         M          4
    ##  4 RM         F          4
    ##  5 RM         M          4
    ##  6 PF         <NA>       4
    ##  7 PP         M          4
    ##  8 RM         M          4
    ##  9 RM         M          4
    ## 10 RM         M          4
    ## 11 PF         M          4
    ## 12 PF         F          4
    ## 13 RM         M          4
    ## 14 RM         M          4
    ## 15 RM         F          4
    ## 16 RM         M          4
    ## 17 RM         M          4

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in
existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the
ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column
within the same call of `mutate()`:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_kg2 = weight_kg * 2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few
rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work
with non-**`dplyr`** functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or
`magrittr` package is loaded).

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to
remove those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`.
The `!` symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where
weight *is not* an `NA`.

Don't forget that in the above code we didn't actually save this
filtered and mutated data anywhere as a new data frame. To do that, you
would need to start by defining a newly named data frame, for example
`surveys_kg`.

``` {.r}
surveys_kg <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes
this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses
each group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes
as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables
for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute
the mean `weight` by sex:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run
off the screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data
frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

When grouping both by `sex` and `species_id`, the last few rows are for
animals that escaped before their sex could be determined and weighted.
You may notice that the last column does not contain `NA` but `NaN`
(which refers to "Not a Number"). To avoid this, we can remove the
missing values for weight before we attempt to calculate the summary
statistics on weight. Because the missing values are removed first, we
can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn't run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()`
function at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the
number of rows to display:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at
the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance,
we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for
each sex:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the
values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter
species first:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we
want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations
found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task,
**`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the
number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
    count(sex) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   sex       n
    ##   <chr> <int>
    ## 1 F     15690
    ## 2 M     17348
    ## 3 <NA>   1748

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen:
grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of
observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is
equivalent to:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) 
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of
rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). If we wanted to count
*combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify
the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an
alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending
order of the count:

``` {.r}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75
observations of the *albigula* species that are not specified for its
sex (i.e. `NA`).

### Reshaping with gather and spread

Keeping your data well-organized for analysis will save you headaches
later on. There's a nice [Data Carpentry lesson
here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data/).

Here are four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1.  Each variable has its own column
2.  Each observation has its own row
3.  Each value must have its own cell
4.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a
table.

In `surveys` , the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables
associated with each record (the unit), values such the weight or sex of
each animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing
records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each species
between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprise of
values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this
means the values of the species in `genus` would become the names of
column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean
weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore
the relationship between the weight of different species within, and
between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a
tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the
observations of interest: average species weight per plot instead of
recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions,
`spread()` and `gather()`.

#### Spreading

`spread()` takes three principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  the *key* column variable whose values will become new column
    names.\
3.  the *value* column variable whose values will fill the new column
    variables.

Further arguments include `fill` which, if set, fills in missing values
with the value provided.

Let's use `spread()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of
each species in each plot over the entire survey period. We use
`filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations
and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the
`mean_weight`. We use the pipe as before too.

``` {.r}
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(genus, plot_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

    ##   ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "col_spec"
    ##  - attr(*, "vars")= chr "genus"
    ##  - attr(*, "drop")= logi TRUE

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread
across multiple rows, 196 observations of 13 variables. Using `spread()`
to key on `genus` with values from `mean_weight` this becomes 24
observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:

``` {.r}
surveys_spread <- surveys_gw %>%
  spread(key = genus, value = mean_weight)

str(surveys_spread)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    24 obs. of  11 variables:
    ##  $ plot_id        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
    ##  $ Baiomys        : num  7 6 8.61 NA 7.75 ...
    ##  $ Chaetodipus    : num  22.2 25.1 24.6 23 18 ...
    ##  $ Dipodomys      : num  60.2 55.7 52 57.5 51.1 ...
    ##  $ Neotoma        : num  156 169 158 164 190 ...
    ##  $ Onychomys      : num  27.7 26.9 26 28.1 27 ...
    ##  $ Perognathus    : num  9.62 6.95 7.51 7.82 8.66 ...
    ##  $ Peromyscus     : num  22.2 22.3 21.4 22.6 21.2 ...
    ##  $ Reithrodontomys: num  11.4 10.7 10.5 10.3 11.2 ...
    ##  $ Sigmodon       : num  NA 70.9 65.6 82 82.7 ...
    ##  $ Spermophilus   : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of species in different
plots, although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

``` {.r}
surveys_gw %>%
  spread(genus, mean_weight, fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### Gathering

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in
the form of `surveys_spread`, where the genus names are column names,
but we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them
into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names
as values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.

`gather()` takes four principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  the *key* column variable we wish to create from column names.
3.  the *values* column variable we wish to create and fill with values
    associated with the key.
4.  the names of the columns we use to fill the key variable (or to
    drop).

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_spread` we would create a key
called `genus` and value called `mean_weight` and use all columns except
`plot_id` for the key variable. Here we drop `plot_id` column with a
minus sign.

``` {.r}
surveys_gather <- surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, -plot_id)

str(surveys_gather)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    240 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ plot_id    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
    ##  $ genus      : chr  "Baiomys" "Baiomys" "Baiomys" "Baiomys" ...
    ##  $ mean_weight: num  7 6 8.61 NA 7.75 ...

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the re-gathered format.
Spreading and then gathering can be a useful way to balance out a
dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include.
This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns,
and it's easier to specify what to gather than what to leave alone. And
if the columns are in a row, we don't even need to list them all out -
just use the `:` operator!

``` {.r}
surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, Baiomys:Spermophilus) %>%
  head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##   plot_id genus   mean_weight
    ##     <int> <chr>         <dbl>
    ## 1       1 Baiomys        7   
    ## 2       2 Baiomys        6   
    ## 3       3 Baiomys        8.61
    ## 4       4 Baiomys       NA   
    ## 5       5 Baiomys        7.75
    ## 6       6 Baiomys       NA

Exporting data
==============

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information
from or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data
sets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R,
there is a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data
frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder,
`data_output`, in our working directory that will store this generated
dataset. We don't want to write generated datasets in the same directory
as our raw data. It's good practice to keep them separate. The `data`
folder should only contain the raw, unaltered data, and should be left
alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it. In contrast, our script
will generate the contents of the `data_output` directory, so even if
the files it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare
a cleaned up version of the data set that doesn't include any missing
data.

Let's start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and
`hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined:

``` {.r}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have
changed through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare
species (i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do
this in two steps: first we are going to create a data set that counts
how often each species has been observed, and filter out the rare
species; then, we will extract only the observations for these more
common species:

``` {.r}
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>% 
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that
`surveys_complete` has 30463 rows and 13 columns by typing
`dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our
`data_output` folder. You'll get an error message if the folder is not
in your current working directory.

``` {.r}
write_csv(surveys_complete, path = "data_output/surveys_complete.csv")
```
